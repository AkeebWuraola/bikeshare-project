This Project began  on the 12th of December, 2021 and first version of analysis was completed by 16th December, 2021.

The README file was created on 23rd December 2021.

## DESCRIPTION
This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States using python pandas. The project answers series of questions as regards the use of shared bikes in moving from one location to another. The Project takes users input by asking for preferred city, month and day for which user wants an analysis for. Here are the popular questions answered from this analysis:
* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* The oldest user (if available)
* The youngest user (if available)
* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

The user is prompted with the choice of consecutively viewing at a glance first 5 rows of data from the city dataset.

## PROGRAM ACCESS
Running the word 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal begins the interactive session.

## FILES USED
The data for the following cities were used in the analysis:
* Washington
* New York City
* Chicago


## CREDITS
The following materials were helpful in the completion of this project:
* Udacity's Introduction to Programming for data science with python course provided the required knowledge on the use of libraries such as pandas and numpy which was helpful in computing the statistics. The mentors on the Knowledge page also provided by Udacity were also helpful in providing the necessary guidance.
* [Panda's Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html) was helpful in providing deep understanding of core concepts.
